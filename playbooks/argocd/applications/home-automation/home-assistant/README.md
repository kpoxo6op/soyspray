# Home Assistant

Home Assistant is an open-source home automation platform that puts local control and privacy first. It integrates with a wide range of smart home devices and services.

## Features

- Local-first architecture for privacy and reliability
- Extensive device and service integrations
- Powerful automation engine
- Web-based user interface
- Mobile apps for iOS and Android
- MQTT integration for Zigbee and other IoT devices

## Integration

Home Assistant connects to the MQTT broker to discover and control devices:
- Automatically discovers Zigbee devices via MQTT discovery from Zigbee2MQTT
- Subscribes to MQTT topics for device states and events
- Publishes MQTT commands to control devices
- Provides unified interface for all home automation devices

## Runtime Device Entries

Home Assistant stores UI-added integration config entries in the
`home-assistant-config` PVC. These are persistent HA runtime state rather than
Kubernetes manifests.

Current TP-Link Smart Home entries added through Home Assistant:

- Tapo L530 bulbs: `light.top`, `light.middle`, `light.bottom`
- Tapo H100 hub at `192.168.20.154`, exposing:
  - `binary_sensor.tapo_t100_motion`
  - `binary_sensor.tapo_t100_cloud_connection`
  - `sensor.tapo_t100_signal_level`
  - `siren.tapo_h100`

The bootstrap ConfigMap keeps HA's declarative automations, scripts, and scenes
that depend on these entities, including the Tapo Relax light behavior.

The Dreame L10s Ultra robot vacuum is visible on the LAN as
`dreame_vacuum_r2228o` at `192.168.20.170`. Home Assistant does not ship a
built-in Dreame Home integration, so the Deployment installs the pinned
`Tasshack/dreame-vacuum` custom component into the HA config PVC on pod start.
The actual Dreame account/device config entry is still HA runtime state in the
PVC after login.
